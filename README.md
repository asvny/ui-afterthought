# UI as an Afterthought

## Overview

"UI as an Afterthought" emphasizes the importance of decoupling business processes from the user interface (UI) in web applications. This project showcases best practices for designing and testing web applications by prioritizing the modeling of business processes before focusing on the UI.

## What

- **Core Concept:** A web application is a user interface that enables customer interactions with business processes.
- **Approach:** Start by modeling business processes and state management independently of the UI.

## Why

- **Business Focus:** State and information management are crucial for generating revenue and should not be an afterthought.
- **Testing and Flexibility:** Decoupling state from the UI simplifies testing and allows for rapid UI iteration and flexibility in switching UI libraries or paradigms.
- **Reduced Complexity:** By managing business processes separately, the UI remains simpler and more maintainable.

## Practical Advice

- Model and test business processes independently of the UI.
- Use UI libraries to capture user input and present data, not to manage business state.
- Maintain a clear separation between domain state and UI state.

## Conclusion

Prioritizing business processes and state management before UI development leads to more robust, flexible, and maintainable web applications.
